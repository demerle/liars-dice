The goal of this project is to create the game liars dice in a fullstack webApp, with user login and "room" functionality for multiplayer.

However, the entire purpose of this project is to see if Claude AI could create an entire working complex application without me writing a single line of code. This means that _I did not write a single line of code in this entire application._

Overall, this project was a failure. There were a seemingly endless errors, and at its current state, I am going to have to revive this project by attempting to fix all of the errors the AI created in its process-->likely as long as it would have taken to just build this myself.
